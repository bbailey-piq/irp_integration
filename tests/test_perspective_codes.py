"""
Tests for perspective-code validation on the analysis result reads.

``_validate_perspective_code`` runs client-side, before any HTTP request, in
``get_elt``, ``get_ep``, ``get_stats`` and ``get_plt``. A code missing from
``PERSPECTIVE_CODES`` is therefore unreachable no matter what Risk Modeler would
have answered, which is why the assertions below are on the recorded request
rather than only on the absence of an exception: passing validation and reaching
the endpoint as ``perspectiveCode`` are two different things.
